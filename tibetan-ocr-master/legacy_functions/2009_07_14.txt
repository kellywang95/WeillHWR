run the boxing algo
and get top of lines
then run the vertical projection code from top of line to another Y pixels down , where Y is the avg line height
then do that all the way to Y/2
get the avg of those vertical projections
the min of that will indicate character boundaries.
the code fragment to do vpp in C will help
just to do better character segmenting
