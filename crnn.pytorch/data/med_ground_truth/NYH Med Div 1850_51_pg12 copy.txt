In America four years.  Last June had several
Attacks of severe pain in the back of the neck  5
Which would last for two or three hours each.
During summer pain became constant except
For an hour or two during the middle of the
Day, and soon began to affect the joints espe
Cially those of the lower extremity.  Still he kept
At work.  Limbs did not appear less strong
Than before attack.  Says pain in the neck
Was of sharp saucerarating character & was
Much aggravated on moving head.  Gradu
Ally he lost power over limbs of upper and low
Er extremity.  As soon as limbs became paral
Yzed the pain disappeared from the joints
And became less sever in neck.  Now both
Legs completely paralyzed, and hands powerless
The arms have some strength so that he
Can raise his hands to his head.  No irregularity
Or trouble can be discovered in the verte
Bral column.  Never had fall or injury.
Family he says are healthy.
