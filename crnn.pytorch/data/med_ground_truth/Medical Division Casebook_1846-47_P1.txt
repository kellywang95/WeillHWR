                    cough for two months, but not very severe until 3 weeks
                     ago.  On admission he was put upon squills, Ipecac, and 
                      Tolu.  For three nights he has been much troubled with 
                      difficulty of breathing, aggravated by a long inspiration.
                      Last night he began to feel pain in his right shoulder
                      increasing with a long breath or on coughing.  His expectoration
                      is free, bronchial, muco-pursulent.  Nine years ago he had
                      a similar attack.  On percussion, there is no marked dulness
                      over any part of the chest, but a well defined mucous
