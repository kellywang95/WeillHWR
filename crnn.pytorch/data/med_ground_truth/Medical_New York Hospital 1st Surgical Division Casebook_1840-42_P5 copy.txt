He was cold almost insensible, near- ly pulseless & moaning constantly. As soon  as he was got into bed, a large sinapism was applied to the belly & bottles of hot  water to the feet. Warm brandy toddy & afterward a little carb. ammonia were ad- ministered. He rallied a little in an hour warmth began to return & he could speak. He was very restless pulse irregular & small.  Several ribs on each side were broken Respiration labored.

The Liver was found ruptured in several places, some of these lacerations  were superficial & did not include the peritoneum, one just to the right of the gall bladder in the anterior edge of the  liver was about an inch in depth. Cel- lular tissue of abdomen much infiltrated with blood. On turning up the Sternum a most extraordinary displacement was  seen, the diaphragm was lacerated to the

extent of four inches at that part where it is in contact with the pericardium. Through  this opening the whole of the stomach, the transverse arch of the colon, & some folds of small intestines had been forced into  the pericardium. Another, rather smaller  laceration of the pericardium existed at its upper part, through which the colon & small intestines passed from the cavity of the pericardium into the left side of the chest & lay in contact with the left  lung, which was collapsed. The lesser curva- ture of the stomach lay against the left  side of the heart, which was pushed very much backwards & to the right. The cellu- lar tissue of the Mediastinal [[sp?]] spaces were filled blood. Most of the ribs on the  right side & several on the left were fractu- red at different points. The other organs were healthy. Head no examined.

Over the part were the [[trephine]] was applied there was a slight mound of the scalp ¾ of an inch in length. 3 circles of bone were removed by the trephine and about 4 [[oz]] of blood found between the dura-mater and the bone. At this stage of the operation it was dis- -covered that the patient was pulseless and decidedly in a moribund condition. Eggnog in small por- -tions was administered.
